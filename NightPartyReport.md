# NIGHT PARTY REPORT

## KFDA Closing Ceremony & Zinneke Parade After-Party (2024) 

*artistic photojournalism project (by __daqhris__)*

_ _ _ 

The story of a spacefaring Zinneke who attends a dance and performance after-party in Brussels, a celebratory prelude to a major planetary parade occuring in our natural habitat, the universe.  

The Zinneke spends twelve-human hours going through a journey on planet Earth that starts at the heart of Brussels (Belgium), parades eastward to Verviers (Liège) and returns to the capital for a night-long dreamlike party at the KFDA Closing Ceremony & Zinneke Parade After-Party (2024). 

This audiovisual piece represents a public report e-wired back by the Zinneke to a celestial observatory center.
