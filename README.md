# Ethereum App: ZinnekeRescueMission

A fictional, playful and engaging initiative created to preserve photographs of the _**Zinneke Parade 2024**_, rescued from the Brussels summer river floods, by smuggling them through Ethereum blockchain rollups.

_**An Ethereum-powered rescue mission, from Brussels to the ether**._


## Description

This is an __*artistic project*__ that facilitates bridging a series of __*photographs*__ in the form of NFTs by distributing them to various user-owned accounts on a variety of __*Ethereum rollups*__.  

It begins with a fictional story that seeks to preserve the last remaining visual memories of joyful events that occurred during the __*2024 Zinneke Parade*__.  

In order to preserve Zinneke's souvenirs without loss of value, visitors to Brussels are invited to send them to their friends around the world, similar to postcards.

## Storyline

In the early 16th century, __*Brussels*__ was invaded by rats because of the __*Senne River*__, which flowed through the city and served as an open sewer. To combat this __*rat invasion*__, the people of Brussels began __*adopting dogs*__.

These dogs, left free, began to __*mix and reproduce*__ wildly, which very quickly gave rise to an enormous number of __*mongrel*__ dogs. To get rid of these __*breedless*__ dogs, which in turn became __*invasive*__, the inhabitants __*drowned*__ them in the Senne.

_The **Zinneke** were therefore originally these small mongrel dogs, without breed, intended to be thrown into the Senne. By extension, we call Zinneke **any animal or even person of mixed origins**_.

Once again in our lifetimes, the covered river bed of the __*Senne*__ was flooded as heavy rains poured down on the capital of Europe. This time, the unexpected weather change coincided with a week of __*Ethereum*__-themed events in Brussels. Then a Brussels-based __*Zinneke*__ rushed to the __*ETHGlobal 2024*__ hackathon to build an out-of-this-world decentralized application.  

This App is part of his call-to-action to __*smuggle photographic souvenirs*__, recently recovered from the __*summer floodwaters*__ of the first __*Ethereum-themed week*__ in Brussels, just a month after the biennial and citywide __*Zinneke Parade*__.

### GeoLocation

The rescue mission is being carried out voluntarily in cyberspace over the terrain of the Ethereum blockchain.  
Launched from a terrestrial location on the territory of the Kingdom of Belgium and the de facto capital of the European Union.

### Coordination  

The mission's management structure is strictly horizontal.
If we try to imagine a visual map of leadership positions, it would be different from a pyramidal organizational chart.
All crucial operations are decentralized by default.

### Logistics

Because this humanitarian initiative is powered by the Ethereum blockchain, all packages flow within the network at the rhythm of computer nodes and validators.

Any volunteer may choose to sponsor the gas expenses of random individuals who run out of gas while on this rescue mission.
