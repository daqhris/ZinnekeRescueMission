# Ethereum dApp: ZinnekeRescueMission

## A fictional initiative created to preserve photographs of the Zinneke Parade, rescued from the Brussels summer river floods, by smuggling them through blockchains

An Ethereum-powered rescue mission, from Brussels to the ether

### Project Description

This is an artistic project that seeks to bridge photographs in the form of NFTs by distributing them to various user-owned accounts on a variety of Ethereum rollups.  

It begins with a fictional story that seeks to preserve the last remaining visual memories of joyful events that occurred during the 2024 Zinneke Parade.  

In order to preserve Zinneke's souvenirs without loss of value, visitors to Brussels are invited to send them to their friends around the world, similar to postcards.  

### Storyline

In the early 16th century, Brussels was invaded by rats because of the Senne River, which flowed through the city and served as an open sewer. To combat this rat invasion, the people of Brussels began adopting dogs.

These dogs, left free, began to mix and reproduce wildly, which very quickly gave rise to an enormous number of mongrel dogs. To get rid of these breedless dogs, which in turn became invasive, the inhabitants drowned them in the Senne.

The Zinneke were therefore originally these small mongrel dogs, without breed, intended to be thrown into the Senne. By extension, we call Zinneke any animal or even person of mixed origins.
